# Linear-Regression-Derivation
In this exercise, linear regression is performed using basic statistical formulae and sklearn. Then we compare the RMSE from both techniques and verify.  

Regression equation for a single x variable is: 
y=b0+b1x
In this case once we solve for minimum RMSE , we get that 
b1= b1 = r sy/sx= summation((xi − x¯)(yi − y¯))/summation((xi − x¯)^2)
